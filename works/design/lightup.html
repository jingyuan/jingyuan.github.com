			    <p>
<!-- Make the text lighter please -->
The Internet has shown a huge impact on life. This project proposes implementing the Internet in the process of landscaping. By the creative use of special technology and the media of light, the connection of reality and virtual life will convert the unused rooftops into attractive outdoor spaces for Shanghai—a densely populated metropolis, and hence arouse creativity, connectivity, and community in real life.</br>
</br>
Technology</br>
Technologies used in the project are maturely developed. The process of turning the data from personal devices to the visible and interactive light can be divided into three steps. The first one is data collection and filtration. A transparent proxy is built for the provided Wi-Fi to collect the information and filter the useful part—the data of color displayed on the webpage. In addition, legality will be confirmed by asking for authority before connecting to the network. The second part is data conversion. The Ethernet based fieldbus is implemented in this step and it links PLCs (programmable Logic Controllers) to the components as sensors, actuators, electric motors, and particularly console lights in this project. The third step is the lighting display. After the data processing of the field bus, information is turned valid for consoles to arrange colors of lighting. RGB LEDs (Light Emitting Diode) are selected to present, which can display different colors through the RGB system with good electric efficiency, fair lifetime and fast cycling.
The selection of color is based on surveys for popular and commonly used web colors. Colors are divided into twelve intervals and each of them has its representative color. These colors are set to display through RGB LEDs in varying illuminations. In this project, time and the users’ relative locations (defined by three Wi-Fi emitters) are the basis of the lighting regulation: 12 thematic colors of most frequently used webpages in the latest three minutes are selected and three sizes of spots and illumination represent frequency and proportion respectively. Moreover, according to the number of the users, only the nearby lights will be on or controlled when slightly used and a website will be built to support the creative and interactive use, as message board, informative Easter eggs and so on.</br>
</br>
We believe in technology optimism and in this project with the application the technology and landscape design, the whole press will be involving and fun. </br>

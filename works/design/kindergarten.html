		     	<h2>Kindergarten Design</h2>
			    <p>
The site is in a small community. The kindergarten is suppose to serve the nearby residents. </br>
</br>
The surrounding residential area is quiet peaceful without too many cars passing by. There are requirements and restrictions for the design of the kindergarten:
There should be 6 classes in this kindergarten, accommodating about 124 children. Each class should have an activity room, a bedroom, a washroom and a storage. An activity space is also needed for all. As for teachers and logistics, there should be an office, a meeting room, a kitchen, a clinic, a washroom, a storage and a carpentry. Due to these restrictions and requirements , and the specialty of the users--children, the design stared after a thorough study and understanding of the behavior and preference of kids from 2-6, especially focused on the impact of the body scale and preference of the color and shape.</br>
</br>
Finally, toy bricks was chosen to be the base geometry and reference to generate the design, hoping that the whole kindergarten can be fun from all aspects for children.</br>

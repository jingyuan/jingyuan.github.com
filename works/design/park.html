		     	<h2>Park Design</h2>
			    <p>
The whole area is left by the former industrial activity that is now in a transformation into an important hub. The site is a part of the area and is aiming to provide activity space and open space for the surround working offices and residents. The whole design is to reduce the affection of the high dyke and make it integrated with the whole park and acting as a connection along the rive rather than a big boundary. The park is roughly divided into two parts, with northern part open and the south closer and quiet. The left over cargos are also taken care of and become part of the park, creating interesting spaces and providing a safe and nice route for home. </br>

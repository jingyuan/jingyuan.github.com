			         	<p><em>Plan</em></br>The plan is showing simply a path through the waterfront and mountain. It looks simple but with thorough consideration of the environment, needs and activities. It is the first project done in the first semester in my Master program in Norway.</p>

			         	<p><em>GIS analysis</em></br>With the regional analysis, the site is chosen between the two lakes. The problematic issues focused in this project is the traffic and low use of the newly build center of Kolbotn. In order the balance the situation, the lake close to the Kolbotn center is chosen to develop into a recreational area due to the natural quality.</p>

Moreover, it is also suggested in this project to improve the water quality by opening up the pipe and through natural processes since most of the incoming water are from pipes with a lack of Oxygen exposure.</p>

			         <p><em>Connectivity</em></br>It is found that there is empty space along the lake that is not allowed to occupy according to the policy. The path is designed to build along the waterfront. There is also a lack of connection between the east and west sides of the lake. A bridge is suggested according to the view and possibility.</p>

			         <p><em>Types of Path</em></br>One type is in the forest with low light just above the ground. One side of the path is set to put snow in winter. Another type is the path along the water. Since the surface level is stable around the year, path is designed a bit higher than the surface to provide a resting space for people while skating. The light is set low above the wooden path to provide nice atmosphere with low impact for the dark winter and night.</p>

		     	<h2>Subtle Interaction</h2>
			    <p>This is project depending on the GIS analysis, which is a powerful tool for urban and landscape studies. The interesting part I experienced in the process is to discover the the place in person and compare it with the GIS mapping result. The whole project is based firmly on the former studies and the designed is generated naturally. Though just a simple path, the design takes care not only the environment, such as water and tress, but also  the activities, like skate, cross country ski, jogging, which are favored by Norwegian people, and the long and dark night and heavy snow during winter, and so on. I learned a lot how to design for a different place and culture and found it is really challenging but attractive. This is also a project that I started to realize my philosophy in designing. I believe in the low impact design can also make good space and experience and I am still working on it.</br>

		     	<h2>Activated Bond</h2>
			    <p>The whole idea for this old town is to make it a real society but not commercial. Another example, the East Gate street duplicated the commercial way and turned out to be a mediocre shopping place, which is not welcoming at all. The West Gate has been left over, it remained its original pattern and has been developing in a natural way though with a lot of problems. The basic methodology is to introduce a system to motivate people and bring social life to the place and eventually break the boundary and make it into the bond between different communities. Though A physical boundary can generate a emotional one, we believe that emotional bond can really help break the physical one.</br>

The Internet has shown a huge impact on life. This project proposes implementing the Internet in the process of landscaping. By the creative use of special technology and the media of light, the connection of reality and virtual life will convert the unused rooftops into attractive outdoor spaces for Shanghai—a densely populated metropolis, and hence arouse creativity, connectivity, and community in real life.</br>

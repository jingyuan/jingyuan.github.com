			         	<p><em>Site</em></br>The site is chosen in a small town in the Northwestern coastal area of Estonia. It is free for student to set any limits. In this project, the work has been done on two scale, one is the village scale: small changes make big difference; another is a site to make a square: small village with vital square.</p>

			         	<p><em>Overview of the village</em></br>A really small village with only about 300 inhabitants. There are many small problems that make the village a place lack of sense of belonging. There isn't any gathering place for the villagers either. The school in the north is a regional school where students live in close manners all come. There is also a lack of waiting place for them as well. There are many small problems like these in the village.</p>

			         	<p><em>Problems</em></br>Firstly the square of the village is now used for multipurpose, road, pedestrian, parking and gathering, which makes the whole situation messy. Secondly, in the south of the village there is an area for facilities, which made a crowd and unpleasure view. Thirdly, the park is invisible though as part of the village.</p>

			         <p><em>Subtle changes to make</em></br>Illustrates solutions for problems. The aim is to make small interventions to lead the big change. Central space is redefined according to different functions; edge of the park is restructured to make is connected; view to the south is redirected to make the whole better; tree lines are rearranged to make visual connections.</p>

			        	<p><em>Move to the small scale</em></br>Since it is a small village, the whole design should be controlled according to the scale. This is the study of the scale that makes the building and the surrounding space all fits into the whole.</p>

			         <p><em>Functions</em></br>As redefined the central space, there should be another better place for people to meet. The east part to the road is chosen for a small square and the small hidden store is moved from the facility area to this place. A flow will generate due to the store, cafe and the bus stop. Here also shows the combinations of the indoor and outdoor space.</p>

			         <p><em>Design</em></br>One of the combinations of the space is chosen due to the surroundings. As the design, the building of store and cafe will step back for the space of a small square where suppose to a welcoming gathering space. The out door space is composed by pavement, seats integrated with slope, small pond with reeds and so on. Simple but interesting.</p>

		     	<h2>Rural Square</h2>
			    <p>This is a short but very interesting task. As we are mostly into urban squares, it is easy to be out of control when meeting a rural space. How to design a meeting space for such a small village becomes one of the key issue in this task. The interesting part is to do minus in the design process, trying to reduce things other than adding up, which is even harder. My focus in this small square is to make simple but multifunctional useful space for people, providing a waiting space for students waiting bus home, a communication chance for people to meet and talk, a convenient stop for people off the bus for home, etc.. These are normal scenes, which are now absent in this village.</br>

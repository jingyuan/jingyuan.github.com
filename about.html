		<p>Hi, I am Jingyuan. A Chinese now live in Oslo, Norway. I have been a student in Landscape Architecture for 5 over years, however, I found lots of interest in web design. I started learning recently. I hope it is not too late and it is not late for always :-). </p>

		<p> I also received some education in Architecture and I am affected by Industry design so much. I do love the design that is really simple and following the function. I am a student in everything, I would like to learn and practice more. </p>

		<p>You can contact me through links from left side. </p>
